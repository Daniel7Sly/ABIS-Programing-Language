ABIS
====
This project is an interpreter for a programming language i created myself.
The first objective to this language was to create something like [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
but with a syntax more similar to assembly. Right now i dont know if this language will
turn into an interpreted scripting language, or a compiled one, or both. (it feels like writing intermediate representation)

### This is still in a very early development stage and a lot of things can change.

# Objectives
- [x] Implement basic actions.
- [x] Implement arrays.
- [ ] Implement structs.
- [ ] Complete the interpreter with basic funcionality (procedures, structs, actions).
- [ ] Add Imports. (Being able to use multiple script files).
- [ ] Documentation.
