ABIS
====
This project is an interpreter for a programming language i created myself.
This interpreter is supposed to be used in projects where you would like to 
give the user some extra functinality by allowing them to run ABIS scripts in your aplication.

This is still in a very early development stage and a lot of things can change.

# Objectives

- [ ] Complete the interpreter with basic funcionality 
(procedures, structs, actions).
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Add Imports. (Being able to use multiple script files).
- [ ] Make the part where the interpreter can be embeded in
projects.

# Instructions and syntax
Check Intruction and syntax Description [here](https://github.com/Daniel7Sly/ABIS-Programing-Language/blob/master/ABIS%20Reference.md).

The syntax of this language is inspired by the programing language [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) by the streamer [tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding).
